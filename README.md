# CryptoZombies Game 🧟‍♂️

Welcome to the CryptoZombies Game repository! This project showcases my skills in blockchain development by implementing a unique and interactive game on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features 🚀

- **Zombie Factory**: Generate unique zombies with distinct DNA sequences.
- **Zombie Feeding**: Feed your zombies to create new zombie types.
- **Zombie Battle**: Engage in battles to level up and gain experience.
- **Crypto Collectibles**: Implement ERC721 tokens for non-fungible zombie collectibles.

## Skills Demonstrated 💡

- **Solidity Programming**: Writing smart contracts in Solidity.
- **Blockchain Development**: Building decentralized applications (dApps).
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Deploying smart contracts to Ethereum.
- **ERC721 Implementation**: Creating and managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
- **Game Mechanics**: Developing engaging game logic and mechanics.
